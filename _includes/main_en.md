#### What to Choose?
The **Stable** version is intended for the general users. Please, try it in the first place. 
Immediately after start of the **Stable** version you will see four different launchers: Pro Main, Pro Alt, Lite Main and Lite Alt. Both Pro launchers support AFR and 60fps. Lite launchers don't have such features but may open videos quickly. I suggest to try all launchers one by one until you find best one.

**YouTube Kids** version is the video service for early childhood education. [More info](https://kids.youtube.com)

**YouTube LIVE** version - watch TV channels on your device. Not available in most countries. [More info](https://tv.youtube.com)

<!-- **MiTV2** and **Mystery** versions primarily intended for the specific device users but you may try them too. -->

<!-- **Additional apk** - video output engines. Used in 1080 Alt and 4K Alt versions. Download is needed only in case when main app can't do it automatically. -->
